Ok, Day 2 has arrived and I've already failed to resist the temptation to scale our new climbing frame.

I arrive at the top, presented by a 10ft hole we've willing paid these men to blow into our roof. Standing there I secretly pray to the gods that theses blokes are not cowboy builders planning to dart away with our deposit.

As I ponder over thoughts of deception and how unnatural it is to have your feet higher than your guttering, yesterday's hangover begins to fade in. 

Ok, time to get down.
