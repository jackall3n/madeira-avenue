How is it so fucking loud in here? We're sat here waiting on our muted Zoom calls expecting one of the guys to scream "It's a prank, bro".

It's Day #2 of the 8 week project and we're pretty sure they're 50% done. It's amazing to think in just 48 hours they've managed to saw out the old roof and build a new one on top, and the best we can achieve in that time is two levels on Crash Bandicoot and a half watched movie.

The noise has become so bad we've retreated to the ground floor, where it appears to be even louder. However, a 4 day weekend is inbound. Our elderly neighbour, who we can only imagine must be vibrating out of her bed as we speak, will be stoked.
